<h2>MyFlix API</h2>

<h3>Project details</h3>
The project aimed to create a RESTful API that execute CRUD operations regarding a movie database.   
It has been developed as an assignment of the CareerFoundry Full Stack Web Developer course.

<h3>Tech stack</h3>
MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

MongoDB - document database
Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

<h3>Requirements</h3>
The API must be a Node.js and Express application.
The API must use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data operations listed above
The API must use at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging.
The API must use a “package.json” file.
The database must be built using MongoDB.
The business logic must be modeled with Mongoose.
The API must provide movie information in JSON format.
The JavaScript code must be error-free.
The API must be tested in Postman.
The API must include user authentication and authorization code.
The API must include data validation logic.
The API must meet data security regulations.
The API source code must be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub.
The API must be deployed to Heroku.
